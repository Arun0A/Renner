This project was an idea of Arun Bhattacharya. I saw numerous people trying hard to rename files in a sequential manner. I made this project to rename multifile sequentially. It has methods where it renames numerically (01,02,03,...n), alphabetically (a,b,c,...,aa,ab,ac,...,ba,bb,bc,...,[676n]). Ex: It can be applied to multiple screenshot arranging.
